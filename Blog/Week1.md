+**Previously:**

* Read the three thesis. 

* First one focused on use of classification, regression network to control the robot. 

* Second one focused on use of deep learning to control the robot in real time. 

* Third one used reinforcement learning for visual control in robot car in simulation. 

* Installed the DL libraries, ROS2 on fresh PC

**Meeting outcomes:**

* reproduce the setup (follow line) to ROS2 + (gazebo/ignition) for collecting the dataset for work ahead in ros2bags

* ROS2bag - mainly images+ speed(translational + rotational) required
